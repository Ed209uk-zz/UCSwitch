      activities you become responsible for in order to receive
      your payment. You can get more information about

    <h2 class="heading-large">What you can do to prepare</h2>
  <p>Activities you can do now to help your switch to Universal Credit;</p>
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>You will need a bank account that you can make payments, from as youâ€™ll need to pay
  your own rent etc. If you have a partner you may want to consider a joint account.</li>
<li>You will need to provide identification for your new claim. You could do this now by
  registering online with <a href="www.gov.uk/verify">GOV.UK Verify</a>. If you can verify yourself through this website
  you may not need to attend a Jobcentre to bring in your identification.</li>
<li>You will need an email account so you could set one of these up now.</li>
<li>You could use the online budgeting support tool to help plan for moving to monthly payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you require extra support in applying for Universal Credit this will be available
  in Jobcentre Plus offices and other local support organisations.</p>
