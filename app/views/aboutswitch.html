    Universal Credit has been introduced to give you the
    support you need to find and progress in work. We want
    you to be able to benefit from all the positives that work
    brings. This guide will help you do that and covers the
    following areas:

      <h1 class="heading-large">Your responsibilities</h1>
      <p>
      When you claim Universal Credit there are a number of
      activities you become responsible for in order to receive
      your payment. You can get more information about
      Universal Credit online at www.gov.uk/universalcredit
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>Complete work search activities for up to 35 hours per week.</li>
      <li>Complete a tailored commitment with your work coach.</li>
      <li>You will be responsible for paying your own rent and other housing costs.</li>
      <li>Report all your changes in circumstances through your account</li>
      <li>Manage your monthly payments and budget monthly.</li>
      <li>Working part-time and able to earn more? Youâ€™re required to seek additional work and increase your earnings</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="yourcommitment"></a>
    <h1 class="heading-large">Your Commitment</h1>
  <p class="bold-small">When you claim Universal Credit you will need to complete and accept a tailored
      commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases your Commitment will be drawn up during a conversation with your work coach at
      your local Jobcentre. It will set out what you have agreed to do to prepare for and look for work,
      or to increase your earnings if you are already working.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be based on your personal circumstances and will be reviewed and updated on an on-going basis.
      Each time it is updated, you will need to accept a new Commitment to keep receiving Universal Credit.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will be able to view your latest Commitment on-line though your account.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you claim Universal Credit as a couple, both of you will need to accept a Commitment.
  You will each have your own Commitment, and yours may be affected if your partner starts
  work or their circumstances change.
